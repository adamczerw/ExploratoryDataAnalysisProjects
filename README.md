# ExploratoryDataAnalysisProjects
Projects I have co-created for the Exploatory Data Analysis course.
## Project 1
The first project was about movies, TV series, books, audiobooks, or games. Its goal was to create a poster in A2 format that would visually present interesting information about chosen topic.
## Project 2
For the second project we had to work with data from Social Diagnosis. The Social Diagnosis is an attempt to supplement the diagnosis based on institutional indicators with comprehensive data about households and the attitudes, mental states, and behaviors of the individuals forming these households. It is a diagnosis of the conditions and quality of life of Poles in their own report (more at http://www.diagnoza.com/). Our task was to prepare a report that includes an analysis of research questions(formulated by ourselves) and a presentation of conclusions drawn from the conducted analyses.
